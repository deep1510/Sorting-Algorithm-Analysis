Project : Sorting Algorithm Analysis

Description: In this project Different algorithm and their time complexity and comparision has been showed.

Language used : JAVA

IDE used : Spring Tool suit-4

Project File Structure 
	-src
	 
	  -Algorithm

            -Insertion_sort.java
	    -Merge_sort.java
	    -Inplace_Quick_sort.java
            -Median_Quick_sort.java

            -Reverse_sort.java 	

How to Run : To run this program you need to run the main method which is in the class Main_sort.java, Where we created different objects of classes, which we have for different algorithms.
